title: "Efficient constrained multi-channel active noise control (ANC) filter design"
excerpt: "Active noise control (ANC) involves using active sources, such as speakers, to produce anti-noise that cancels out the original unpleasant noise. A constrained optimization problem can be formulated to incorporate real-life practical constraints into the ANC controller design, such as robust stability, noise amplification, and output power constraints. I developed a convex reformulation method for this ANC optimization problem, enabling it to be solved efficiently. The computational time can be reduced from the order of hours to seconds. <br/><img src='/images/Research/Constrained_ANC/ANC_cover.png' style='width: 200px; height: auto;'>"
